### Getting involved

cuvis.hub welcomes your enthusiasm and expertise!

With providing our SDK wrappers on GitHub, we aim for a community-driven open 
source application development by a diverse group of contributors.
Cubert GmbH aims for creating an open, inclusive, and positive community.
Feel free to branch/fork this repository for later merge requests, open 
issues or point us to your application specific projects.
Contact us, if you want your open source project to be included and shared 
on this hub; either if you search for direct support, collaborators or any 
other input or simply want your project being used by this community.
We ourselves try to expand the code base with further more specific 
applications using our wrappers to provide starting points for research 
projects, embedders or other users.

### Getting help

general and application related issues should be directed to the
