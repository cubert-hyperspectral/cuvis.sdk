# CUVIS C# SDK

For the C# SDK, you will also need to install/copy-paste some files manually.

## Installing Cuvis C# SDK

In order to install the C# SDK, the Cuvis application must be installed first.

Download the installer for windows and the `cuvis_csil.dll` file, the `cuvis_netstubs.dll` file
 as well as the `cuvis_donet_wrapper.dll` file [here](
https://cloud.cubert-gmbh.de/index.php/s/kKVtx0x2fmYqVgx).

After installing, check out the repository and copy the `.dll` files and the main `cuvis.dll` from the SDK installation into a single working directory.
