# Cubert Community Hub
#### This is a place to collaborate on projects, that are being build upon the Cubert SDK and work with Cubert Hyperspectral Cameras. 

The repository is aimed at students, researchers and professionals alike. It contains everything you need to connect and integrate Cubert hyperspectral cameras into your processing pipeline in various programming languages. Even without a camera, you can start straight ahead with the demo data provided. Additionally it contains a classification engine in python, designed to work efficiently and transparently on cubert hyperspectral data cubes. The engine lets you train, process and evaluate your dataset and the resulting model can easily deployed in the field.
