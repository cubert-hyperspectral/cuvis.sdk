# Cubert Community Hub
### This is a place to collaborate on projects, that are being build upon the Cubert SDK and work with Cubert Hyperspectral Cameras. 

The repository is aimed at students, researchers and professionals alike. It contains __everything you need__ to connect and integrate __Cubert hyperspectral cameras__ into your processing pipeline in __various programming languages__. Even without a camera, you can start straight ahead with the __demo data provided__. 

Additionally it contains a __classification engine__ in python, designed to work efficiently and transparently on cubert hyperspectral data cubes. The engine lets you __train, process and evaluate__ your dataset and the resulting model can __easily be deployed__ in the field.
