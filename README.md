This repository contains __everything you need__ to connect and integrate __Cubert hyperspectral cameras__ into your processing pipeline in __various programming languages__. Even without a camera, you can start straight ahead with the __demo data provided__. 

The supported wrappers can be found in the top-level folder named after the respective languages. Notice that these are submodules linking to other cuvis repositories.
The examples for all those wrappers can be found in the `examples` folder named after the respective language.

Further, we provide a set of example measurements to explore [here](https://cloud.cubert-gmbh.de/index.php/s/3oECVGWpC1NpNqC).
These measurements are also used by the examples mentioned above.
Also in the folder `sample_data` you can find a description of the provided data.
